I have developed a dynamic webpage aimed at promoting fitness and well-being, allowing users to explore a comprehensive list of exercises. The key features of the Fitness-24/7 Gym webpage include:

ðŸ”¹ Sorting Capability: Users can sort exercises by target muscle groups and equipment, ensuring personalized workout plans.

ðŸ”¹ YouTube Integration: Get recommendations and tutorials directly from YouTube on how to perform each exercise effectively.

The tech stack I utilized for this project includes:

React JS: For building a responsive and interactive user interface.
CSS: To design a visually appealing and user-friendly webpage.
ExerciseDb API: To provide a diverse and extensive list of exercises.
YouTube Search and Download API: For fetching relevant YouTube videos that demonstrate the exercises.
